# Fairweather Ride 2025

A silly website about tyler and his bike.

## Technology overview

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Hosted on Netlify

## Local setup

This is a basic HTML site, but for local dev I use [live-server](/www.npmjs.com/package/live-server), installed as a dependency.

```
npm i
npm start
```

http://localhost:8000
